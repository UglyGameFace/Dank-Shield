# Active Task

## Active task / outcome

**DANK-SHIELD-TOKE-381 — fix /toke preferred-channel discovery on large servers**

Explicit FORCE SWITCH accepted:
**Fix /toke channel picker**

Reason:
`/toke` setup cannot select the user's valid general chat channel from the visible picker.

Production baseline: `main` = `534614801e6c19dfbc248e100022e1d5c8c87bc1` (PR #379 merged; exact-head CI green).

Active branch: `fix/toke-channel-picker-pagination`.

Active issue: #381 — **Toke setup text-channel picker omits expected general channel**.\n\nActive PR: #382 — **Fix /toke large-server channel picker discovery** (draft).

## Scope

Trace and fix only the `/toke` / Community & Pings preferred-channel picker and the shared resource-browser behavior required for correctness on large guilds. Preserve guild-scoped persistence, staff authorization, Community & Pings ownership, Search-Safe lookup, and existing /toke send semantics.

## Findings / root cause

The production screenshot contains exactly **25** channel options. That is Discord's maximum number of options in one string select.

The current Community & Pings **Toke Channel** route already uses the canonical `DankGuildResourceBrowserView` and does not permission-filter normal text channels. The shared browser discovers from the guild cache, retains every matching resource, and pages at 25 items. On a server with more than 25 text channels, a valid channel can therefore be on page 2+ even though the opened mobile dropdown visually looks like a complete list.

The shared browser currently leaves **Next / Previous / Search** outside the opened dropdown. On Discord mobile the 25-option sheet covers those controls, so a user can reasonably conclude a page-2 channel is missing.

A second duplicate path also existed in `public_toke.py`: the legacy `CommunityPingSetupView` / `open_toke_preset_setup` used Discord-native `DankRoleSelect` / `DankChannelSelect` selectors. Repository reference search found no external caller for that old view, but retaining it would allow the same divergent discovery behavior to return later.

## Execution path

Current canonical manager path:
`/dank home or /role -> Community & Pings Manager -> Toke Channel -> public_community_pings.CommunityPingsManagerView -> DankGuildResourceBrowserView -> guild.channels -> paged DankPickerView -> existing guild_config write`.

The save owner remains `public_community_pings.py`; the shared browser owns discovery/search/paging only.

## Changes on active branch

- Shared resource browser now makes pagination explicit in the select placeholder when multiple pages exist, e.g. **Page 1/3**.
- Its embed states the exact visible range, e.g. **1–25 of 63**, explains Discord's 25-item dropdown limit, and tells mobile users to close the list and use **Next / Previous** or **Search**.
- Retired the unused legacy `CommunityPingSetupView` native-selector implementation from `public_toke.py`.
- `open_toke_preset_setup` remains as a compatibility entrypoint but delegates to the canonical Community & Pings manager.
- Added regression coverage for a 63-text-channel guild where `general-chat` is beyond page 1 and remains discoverable through page 2 and Search.
- Added regression coverage forbidding `DankChannelSelect` / `DankRoleSelect` from returning to `public_toke.py` setup and requiring Toke Channel to use `DankGuildResourceBrowserView`.
- Updated picker-adoption documentation.

## Validation required

Before merge:
- compile;
- focused resource-browser tests;
- focused Community & Pings / /toke tests;
- full pytest / Dank Shield CI;
- existing picker/navigation regressions;
- branch must remain based on current production main;
- final diff/reference check must show no unrelated work and no live caller of the retired view.

After merge/deploy:
- Android canary in the affected large server;
- open Community & Pings -> Toke Channel;
- verify the picker visibly reports page/range when >25 channels exist;
- verify Next reaches later channels;
- verify Search finds the expected general chat by current/styled name;
- save it;
- run `/toke` and confirm the card posts to the selected channel.

## Suspended work

Issue #375 Protection/navigation is suspended by explicit FORCE SWITCH.
Preserved state:
- PR #379 merged to `main` as `534614801e6c19dfbc248e100022e1d5c8c87bc1`;
- exact-head Dank Shield CI and companion workflows passed;
- production/mobile canary is still required before issue #375 can be closed;
- no additional Protection changes should be made while #381 is active.

Issue #380 **True master runtime ownership + production-path audit** remains the next repo-wide audit task after the current active task unless another explicit FORCE SWITCH occurs.

## Suspended Protection task record

## Production evidence

After PR #376 deployed successfully on Discloud:
- the original red Discord timeout changed behavior;
- pressing **Home → Safety & Moderation → Protection** can now appear to do nothing;
- PR #376 already defers before persisted reads and edits the original panel after loading.

The failed canary proves acknowledgement alone was insufficient.

## Root cause found after PR #376

The merged refresh owner acknowledges the interaction and then waits on:

- fresh guild configuration load;
- Spam Guard settings load.

Those reads were joined without any bounded completion deadline or degraded fallback.
If either read stalls after Discord has already acknowledged the click, mobile no longer shows a timeout error; it simply leaves the user staring at an unchanged/deferred interaction.

Additionally, Spam Guard can return an `unavailable:...` source without throwing, so exception-only degradation would be incomplete.

A second canary/CI pass exposed one more pre-ack hole: public Protection entry routes still called `_require_setup_permission()` before the shared refresh owner. For delegated staff, that permission path can consult configured control-role state and may synchronously fetch configuration on a cold cache. The protection refresh itself could therefore be perfectly deferred while the button still stalled before it ever reached that refresh.

## Current fix

The shared Protection owner now:

1. uses one idempotent Protection-entry acknowledgement helper **before authorization and backend I/O** across the slash command, categorized navigation, legacy home button, setup button, advanced setup route, service entry, and Invite Shield return path;
2. immediately edits the original interaction to a visible **Opening Protection Center** loading state;
3. loads guild config and Spam Guard behind bounded, independent read-only waits;
4. uses the existing cached guild config path when a fresh config refresh is slow/unavailable;
5. falls back to explicit unknown/default-safe Spam Guard state when that source cannot load;
6. treats returned `unavailable:...` Spam Guard state as degraded even without an exception;
7. still renders the Protection Center in degraded mode instead of leaving the button visually dead;
8. disables all mutating controls while live state is incomplete;
9. leaves only **Retry Live State** and **Close** enabled in degraded mode;
10. shows an explicit warning that no protection setting was changed by the fallback;
11. keeps live security-stat repair after the panel is already visible;
12. uses one generic runtime-configurable load budget:
    `DANK_PROTECTION_PANEL_LOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

## No hardcoding contract

This fix contains:
- no guild IDs;
- no role IDs;
- no channel IDs;
- no server names;
- no owner-specific exceptions;
- no per-server timeout branch.

The load budget is process configuration and applies generically to every guild.

## Safety

- no guessed protection state may authorize mutations;
- incomplete live state fails closed;
- cached state may be displayed with an explicit degraded warning, but mutation remains locked;
- existing AntiNuke owner-only controls remain owner-only;
- no changes to AntiNuke hostile-reputation semantics from PR #376;
- no global guild sweep;
- no database migration;
- no new persistence authority.

## Validation required

Before merge:
- regression coverage that every public Protection entry acknowledges before its permission check;
- focused runtime test that acknowledgement is idempotent;
- focused runtime test for visible loading before slow reads;
- focused runtime tests for a hung config read;
- focused runtime tests for a hung Spam Guard read;
- cached-config fallback test;
- returned `unavailable:...` Spam Guard degradation test;
- degraded view enables only Retry + Close;
- static check that loading UI appears before backend reads;
- exact-head full CI;
- exact-head Protection/AntiNuke focused checks;
- branch 0 behind main;
- diff hygiene.

After merge:
- exact merge SHA Discloud success;
- canonical post-merge CI;
- Supabase workflow if triggered;
- Android canary:
  1. open Safety & Moderation;
  2. press Protection;
  3. confirm immediate loading state;
  4. confirm final Protection Center opens;
  5. press Refresh;
  6. confirm it remains responsive;
  7. if backend is degraded, confirm Retry/Close only and no settings mutation.

## CI failure already resolved

Exact head `3fea2335e2309f3318072ff6e591ea8b66dbec53` failed Dank Shield CI only because the old acknowledgement regression expected the first panel edit to occur after config/spam reads. The new visible-loading contract intentionally performs a loading edit before those reads. The test now verifies the correct order: defer → loading edit → config/spam → final edit → stats.

That review also exposed and fixed the remaining pre-ack permission-check hole described above.

Exact head `7bf5c3edca7960e708df4825f581d6f84453d47f` then failed only on two stale test contracts:
- a static test still required the literal `interaction.response.defer` inside `_refresh_panel()` even though acknowledgement is now deliberately centralized in `_ack_protection_entry()`;
- an advanced-setup test used a minimal fake response that never modeled acknowledgement because the old route performed permission checking first.

Those tests now validate the new architecture directly: the shared ack helper owns Discord defer, and the setup route order is **ack → permission → Protection refresh**.


## Protection runtime-ownership correction

The latest CI failure exposed a deeper architecture defect in the setup compatibility layer:

- `stoney_verify/commands_ext/public_setup_compact.py` was still monkey-patching `setup._open_protection_options` at import/runtime;
- that wrapper performed setup authorization before the canonical Protection acknowledgement owner;
- the permanent setup audit and runtime-integrity test incorrectly required that monkey patch to exist, so the audit could pass while violating the stated native-ownership goal.

Correction on this branch:

- retired the Protection-specific runtime reassignment and saved-original-function attribute;
- Protection setup navigation now calls the native `public_setup_recommend._open_protection_options` directly;
- changed runtime-integrity coverage to require the native function and absence of `_DANK_SETUP_ORIGINAL_OPEN_PROTECTION_OPTIONS`;
- changed `tools/audit_setup_safety.py` to fail if the retired Protection wrapper, saved-original marker, or reassignment returns.

This correction is part of the same Protection incident because the runtime replacement directly caused the pre-ack permission regression. Other unrelated setup compatibility wrappers remain outside this active task unless evidence shows they affect Protection.

## Next step

Validate PR #377 on the new exact head. Patch only evidence-backed failures. If CI is green, complete final diff/branch hygiene, mark ready, merge with the exact expected head, verify post-merge CI/Supabase/Discloud, then rerun the Android Protection canary. Do not close issue #375 until that live canary passes.


## Post-merge Android canary failure — permanent loading card

Production merge SHA: `1fac08e87c534328ee94263156bcbd1b3d33c3e7`.

Android canary evidence after PR #377:
- Home → Protection acknowledges successfully;
- the original private response is replaced with **Loading Protection Center…**;
- the loading card can remain indefinitely and the final controls never appear.

Execution-path finding:
- `_refresh_panel()` bounded only guild-config and Spam Guard reads;
- after those reads, the real AntiNuke readiness/embed construction, Protection view construction, and final Discord edit were outside the terminal-state guarantee;
- Home/navigation callers invoke the canonical refresh directly, so an exception after the loading edit can leave the loading card as the permanent UI;
- existing tests stubbed `_protection_embed` and `ProtectionCenterView`, so they did not exercise the production render/send boundary;
- the AntiNuke Permission health field could exceed Discord's 1,024-character embed field-value limit because multiple verbose hierarchy/channel blockers were joined without truncation. A Discord 400 on the final edit then retried the same invalid payload and could leave the loading card unchanged.

Current hotfix branch: `fix/protection-loading-terminal-state`.

Hotfix behavior:
- cap the dynamic AntiNuke field to Discord's field-value limit;
- make the canonical refresh owner catch unexpected state-load and panel-render failures;
- bound the final Discord edit;
- if the final panel cannot be rendered/sent, replace the loading card with a plain terminal error containing an Error ID;
- never resend the same rejected full panel as the fallback;
- add regression tests for overlong AntiNuke health content, render failure after loading, and final-edit rejection after loading.

Issue #375 remains open. Do not claim the Protection incident resolved until exact-head CI, merge/deploy, and Android canary all pass.


## PR #378 Android canary — actual render crash and stale setup navigation

The post-merge Android canary on production `0ce2b74856262be1b74ef3066426d85b89136d9f` produced terminal Protection errors instead of hanging, which exposed the exact remaining runtime conflict.

Production diagnostics/logs recorded both navigation routes failing at the same renderer boundary:

- Error IDs `DANK-653ABC6A` and `DANK-50BEDB33`;
- stage `protection_panel_render_failed`;
- `TypeError: _patch_ui.<locals>.embed() got an unexpected keyword argument 'channel'`;
- callers included `dank:navigation:feature:protection:v1` and `dank_setup_security:protection`.

Root cause:
- `anti_nuke_product_policy_runtime._patch_ui()` still replaced the canonical Protection embed, view class, and AntiNuke UI callbacks after import;
- its replacement embed retained the old four-argument signature while the canonical Protection renderer now supplies `channel=` and `load_warning=`;
- this was a live runtime monkey patch that the prior ownership audit did not prohibit.

Related navigation evidence from the same canary:
- `/dank home` already uses `navigation_registry.CATEGORIES`;
- `/dank setup` still used a separate hard-coded nine-item `FEATURE_AREAS` list;
- tests explicitly required those stale labels, so CI preserved the divergence.

Current correction:
- Strict Lockdown UI/state/toggles now live natively in `commands_ext/public_protection_center.py`;
- canonical Protection accesses AntiNuke through the module service owner so post-import policy/readiness behavior is not bypassed by stale captured aliases;
- `anti_nuke_product_policy_runtime.py` retains engine/policy behavior but no longer replaces Protection UI functions/classes;
- obsolete self-applying Protection presentation guards are deleted after reference verification;
- setup's feature picker derives from `navigation_registry.CATEGORIES` and routes through the canonical category owner;
- unit/static tests and `tools/audit_setup_safety.py` now reject Protection UI rebindings, retired patch files, and a standalone setup taxonomy.

Validation is still required. Do not claim issue #375 resolved until exact-head CI passes, the branch is merged/deployed, and Android canary confirms both Protection entry routes and the setup category picker.


## PR #379 CI failure correction

First exact-head CI on `f431928dc1de0efed617c2b5958d3fabef77a968` completed with **2390 passed / 9 failed** in Dank Shield CI. All other workflows passed.

The 9 failures were stale regression contracts, not a new production runtime failure:

- 2 AntiNuke trust tests still monkey-patched removed `public_protection_center.get_antinuke_settings` / `save_antinuke_settings` aliases even though Protection now intentionally calls `anti_nuke_service` as the authoritative runtime owner.
- 7 setup picker tests still required the retired `core/tickets/verification/security/logs/design/history` route map. The new picker routes canonical `navigation_registry.CATEGORIES` keys through `public_command_surface_v2._open_category`; the old FakeResponse then failed on the real Discord `response.is_done()` contract.

Correction:
- AntiNuke trust tests now patch `protection.anti_nuke_service`, matching the actual execution path.
- the setup picker regression test now asserts every canonical category routes through `public_command_surface_v2._open_category`; it no longer preserves the retired route map.

Current validation head: `71bb1c5375233a7595171d4153561062da20dfd3`. Dank Shield CI run #3346 and the companion workflows are in progress. Do not merge until this exact head passes.
